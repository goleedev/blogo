## Styled-jsx

It is a <mark>CSS-in-JS library</mark> that allows you to write encapsulated and scoped CSS to style your components.

The styles you introduce for one component won't affect other components, allowing you to add, change and delete styles without worrying about unintended side effects.

## Basic Syntax (Style Components)

With the following basic syntax, you can style components just as the way you do with CSS.

```jsx
<style jsx>{`
	.some_class {
		...
	}
`}</style>
```

## Basic Syntax (Style Globally)

Basically, styled-jsx is scoped to style the elements, but you can still style them globally.

```jsx
<style jsx>{`
	.some_class {
		...
	}
`}</style>
```
