## Abstract Data Structures?

An abstract, mathematical model of a collection of data elements including the allowed operations on this collection

### Vectors

- A vector is a <mark>1) finite</mark> <mark>2) fixed size</mark> <mark>3) sequential</mark> data collection.

- Construct new vector of length n = new Vector w(n)

- Operations & Pseudocodes as follows:

![vector](/static/images/vector.png)

### Queues

- The fundamental concept underlying a queue is that there is a resource,

but it <mark>cannot be immediately accessed</mark>, so there needs to be a wait.

- First In First Out (FIFO)

- Construct new queue = new Queue q

- Operations & Pseudocodes as follows:

![queue](/static/images/queue.png)

### Vectors VS Queues

![vec-queue](/static/images/vec-queue.png)

... and all elements are accessible in a vector, but a queue has only two (at most).

### Stacks

- A nice analogy to a stack is to think of <mark>a pile or stack of plates</mark>. Because the resource, the plates, can be smashed easily if we\'re not careful, we **add or remove plates from the pile from the top**.

- Last In First Out (LIFO)

- Construct new stack = new Stack s

- Operations & Pseudocodes as follows:

![stack](/static/images/stack.png)

### Stacks VS Queues

![queue-stack](/static/images/queue-stack.png)

... and

1. a queue is FIFO when a stack is LIFO

2. two elements, the head and the tail, are accessible in the queue when only one element is accessible called the top of the stack.
