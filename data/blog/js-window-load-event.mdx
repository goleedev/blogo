## Window Load Event

The **`load`** event is fired when the whole page has loaded, including all resources.

It is used to easily check if the whole page is loaded or not.

```js
window.addEventListener('load', (event) => {
  console.log('page is fully loaded')
})
or
window.onload = (event) => {
  console.log('page is fully loaded')
}
```
