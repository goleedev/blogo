## React (Handling Events)

When using React, you generally don’t need to call `addEventListener` to add listeners to a DOM element after it is created. Instead, just provide a listener when the element is initially rendered.

## Too Many Re-renders Error

Too many re-renders error may occur when onClick prop has a problem.

```js
const [value, setValue] = useState(0)

;<button onClick={setValue(value + 1)}>+</button>
```

The example above lead to the error because everything between the curly braces get evaluated immediately, which means it is called in every render loop.

The problem needs to be fixed by wrapping the function with an arrow function as follows:

```js
const [value, setValue] = useState(0)

;<button onClick={() => setValue(value + 1)}>+</button>
```
