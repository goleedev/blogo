## useState

According to React documents, a Hook is a special function that lets you “hook into” React features.

For example, `useState` is a Hook that lets you add React state to function components.

Simply put, it is used when you add or handle the state to a function component.

## Set a State Array

```js
const [theArray, setTheArray] = useState(initialArray)
```

## Add a New Element

```js
setTheArray((oldArray) => [...oldArray, newElement])
or
setTheArray([...theArray, newElement])
```
