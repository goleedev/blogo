## NPM Start Error

```bash
Manually installing incompatible versions is known to cause hard-to-debug issues
.

If you would prefer to ignore this check, add SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK=true to an .e
nv file in your project.
That will permanently disable this message but you might encounter other issues.

To fix the dependency tree, try following the steps below in the exact order:

  1. Delete package-lock.json (not package.json!) and/or yarn.lock in your proje
ct folder.
  2. Delete node_modules in your project folder.
  3. Remove "webpack" from dependencies and/or devDependencies in the package.js
on file in your project folder.
  4. Run npm install or yarn, depending on the package manager you use.
```

## How to Handle

1. Create `.env` file on the root directory.
2. Add `SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK=true ` in the file.
