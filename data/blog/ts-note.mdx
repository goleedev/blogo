## TypeScript

- TS = JS + Type System

- Type System 1) helps us catch errors during development 2) uses 'type annotations' to analyze our code 3) only active during development 4) does not provide any performance optimization.

- TS Code -> TS Compiler -> JS Code

## Environment Setup

- `npm i -g typescript ts-node`

- `ts-node = tsc + node`

## Types

- Type Annotations : code we add to tell ts what type of value a variable will refer to (we tell ts the type)

- Type Inference : ts tries to figure out what type of value a variable refers to (ts guesses the type)
