## React Router

React Router is the standard routing library for React.

It is a collection of navigational components that compose declaratively with your application.

## BrowserRouter VS HashRouter

### BrowserRouter

- It uses [history API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API).

- Client-side React application is able to maintain clean routes like `example.com/react/route` but needs to be backed by web server.

### HashRouter

- It uses `URL hash`, it puts no limitations on supported browsers or web server.

- Server-side routing is independent of client-side routing.

👉 Most importantly, HashRouter use cases aren't limited to SPA.

## Use Cases

<mark>HashRouter</mark> - small client side applications which doesn't need backend

<br />

<mark>BrowserRouter</mark> - big production-ready applications which serve backend
