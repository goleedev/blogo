## README

A [README](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/README) is a text file that **introduces and explains a project**.

It contains information that is commonly required to understand what the project is about.

In most cases, **markdown** is used to write the README.

## Markdown

[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) is a way to style text on the web.

You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown.

## Recommended Templates

Here is my **personal favorite** template to write a README.

It contains what I needed:

- ToC
- Getting Started (Installation)
- Contributing
- License
- Acknowledgements
- Badages
- Live Demo
